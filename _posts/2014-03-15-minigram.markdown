Minigram is a web application written with [Silex Micro-framework][silex-link]. What it does is
that it prints Instagram photos constantly checking for a #hashtag that you specify.
Check out [github repo][minigram-repo].

#### Auto-print photos:

In order to auto-print photos you have to run Minigram through Google Chrome Kiosk Mode (or any browser with kiosk print support).
When Chrome runs in kiosk mode it does not need a user interaction when print is triggered with `javascript:window.print();`

Run Chrome in kiosk mode: `chrome --kiosk --kiosk-printing`

Happy printing!
